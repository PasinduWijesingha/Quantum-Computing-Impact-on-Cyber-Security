This Project happend under univercity of SLIIT, Faculty of computing
This era, people call it as Information era. Nowadays most of fields are based on information. Businesses, Banking systems, and many other larger fields need Information to increase their productivity. That is the reason cybersecurity takes a valuable place in this era. But are we safe on the internet? It is based on our security. This report talks about quantum computers, cybersecurity, Quantum theory, and principles. and considering how quantum computing impacts cybersecurity. Quantum technologies take a high impact on our data encryption methods. Quantum technology has a number of ways to impact encryption. In this report, I have mentioned those areas as well as uses about these technologies.

Hear I am focusing about Quantum physics, History to current cyber security evolution, Quantum computing
